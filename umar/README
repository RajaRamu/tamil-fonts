This branch of Tahmizha's github repository for Tamil-Fonts is for the further development and distribution of the 4 Unicode Tamil TTF fonts that were released under GUN/GPL (then version 2) in 2003-2004 by the late Umar Thamby via the site http://www.geocities.com/csd_one/fonts/ . That geocities distribution sight (which had been under yahoo.com) is no longer available.

The four fonts are as follows:

ThendralUni
TheneeUni
TheneeUniTx
VaigaiUni

The Thamizha group (http://thamizha.com) feels honoured in continuing the works initiated by the late Umar Thamby whose contributions towards development of free and open source softwares for Tamil use in computers are invaluable. And these our efforts are dedicated to late Umar Thamby.
